( 2.1 ) Patients should also receive a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist concurrently or have had bilateral orchiectomy. ( 2.1 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosage The recommended dose of NUBEQA is 600 mg (two 300 mg tablets) taken orally, twice daily, with food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Continue treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs. Patients receiving NUBEQA should also receive a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist concurrently or have had a bilateral orchiectomy.

        "mechanism_of_action": "12.1 Mechanism of Action Darolutamide is an androgen receptor (AR) inhibitor. Darolutamide competitively inhibits androgen binding, AR nuclear translocation, and AR-mediated transcription. A major metabolite, ketodarolutamide, exhibited similar in vitro activity to darolutamide. In addition, darolutamide functioned as a progesterone receptor (PR) antagonist in vitro (approximately 1% activity compared to AR). Darolutamide decreased prostate cancer cell proliferation in vitro and tumor volume in mouse xenograft models of prostate cancer.",
        "pharmacokinetics": "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following administration of 600 mg twice daily, darolutamide mean (%CV) steady-state peak plasma concentration (C max ) is 4.79 mg/L (30.9%) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to 12 hours (AUC 12h ) is 52.82 hâˆ™Âµg/mL (33.9%). Steady-state is reached 2â€“5 days after repeated dosing with food, with an approximate 2-fold accumulation. The exposure (C max and AUC 12 ) of the darolutamide and the active metabolite ketodarolutamide increase in a nearly dose-proportional manner in the dose range of 100 to 700 mg (0.17 to 1.17 times the approved recommended dosage). No further increase in darolutamide exposure was observed at 900 mg twice daily (1.5 times the approved recommended dosage). Absorption Darolutamide C max is reached approximately 4 hours after administration of a single 600 mg oral dose. The absolute bioavailability is approximately 30% following oral administration of a NUBEQA tablet containing 300 mg darolutamide under fasted condi",
